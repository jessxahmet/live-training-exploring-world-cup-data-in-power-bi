# Live Training - Exploring World Cup Data in Power BI 
This repository is the accompanying repository for the Power BI live training. Here's a guide to the repository: 
- The starter and final workbook can be in the Workbooks folder.  
- The Resources folder contains the background image created by me to utilize in the live training. 
- You can find the data that populates the starter workbook in the Datasets folder. The full 27 CSV files from Josh Fjelstul can be found [here](https://github.com/jfjelstul/worldcup)

Please share your own takes on this analysis on LinkedIn, so we can see the excellent work you've created!
